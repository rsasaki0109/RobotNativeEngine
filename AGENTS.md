## Project

Robot Native Engine (RNE) is an open-source robot-native game engine.

Robots are not plugins. The core concepts are:

- World Entity
- Robot Entity
- Sensor Entity
- Actuator Entity
- Agent Entity
- Episode Entity

ROS2 is an adapter only. Do not add ROS2, rclrs, rclcpp, DDS, or ROS message dependencies to core crates.

## Repository Layout

## Commands

Use these commands before submitting changes:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p xtask -- ci-headless
cargo run -p xtask -- ci
```

For a single crate:

```bash
cargo test -p rne_core
cargo clippy -p rne_core --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Coding Rules

- Keep core crates ROS2-free.
- Do not introduce global mutable state.
- Do not use wall-clock time inside simulation logic. Use SimClock.
- Do not make rendering required for simulation tests.
- Do not put physics-engine-specific handles in rne_robot or rne_world.
- Do not expose Rapier, MuJoCo, PhysX, or Bullet types through rne_physics public traits.
- All public structs must derive Debug where reasonable.
- Public APIs must have rustdoc.
- All new components go in `components.rs`.
- All new systems go in `systems.rs`.
- All new resources go in `resources.rs`.
- All new events go in `events.rs`.
- Use explicit units in field names: `_m`, `_rad`, `_s`, `_hz`, `_nm`.
- Prefer small immutable data structs.
- Use `unsafe` only with a `// SAFETY:` explanation and a test covering the invariant.
- Any new plugin must include a manifest and a minimal example.
- Any new adapter must not change core types to fit the external system.
- Any new sensor must define timestamp behavior, latency behavior, and noise behavior.
- Any new actuator must define limits and failure behavior.
- Any new feature must include tests and a short docs update.

## Testing Requirements

For each feature, add at least one of:

- Unit test in the crate
- Integration test in `tests/integration`
- Determinism test in `tests/determinism`
- Golden serialization test in `tests/golden`
- Runnable example in `examples`

Simulation logic must be testable in headless mode.

## Determinism Requirements

- Use deterministic ordering for entity iteration where results are externally visible.
- Do not use random numbers without an explicit seed from WorldRandom.
- Replay tests must compare stable hashes of world state.
- Floating point comparisons must use crate-approved tolerances.

## Module Boundary Rules

- `rne_math` depends on no RNE crate.

- `rne_slam` may depend on `rne_nav`, `rne_core`, `rne_ecs`, and `rne_math`.

- Offline importers such as `rne_plateau` may depend on `rne_traffic`.
- `adapters/*` may depend on external ecosystems such as ROS2.

Forbidden:

- Core crates must not depend on `adapters/*`.
- Core crates must not depend on ROS2.
- `rne_robot` must not depend on Rapier, MuJoCo, PhysX, or Bullet.
- `rne_dynamics` must not depend on a physics backend, a renderer, ROS 2, or an
  external dynamics library (Pinocchio, RBDL, Crocoddyl); it builds on
  `rne_robot` and `rne_physics` model components without changing them.
- `rne_legged` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or an
  external planning/control stack; it provides deterministic template planners
  that a physics backend or policy layer can consume.
- `rne_wbc` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or an
  external control stack; it builds on `rne_dynamics` and `rne_robot` types
  without changing them.
- `rne_oc` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or an external
  optimal-control/dynamics library (Crocoddyl, Pinocchio, RBDL); it builds on
  `rne_dynamics` types without changing them.
- `rne_sensor` must not require a renderer unless the specific sensor is camera-like.
- `rne_traffic` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, geospatial importer,
  robotics adapter, or external traffic simulator.
- `rne_nav` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or external
  navigation/SLAM stack; the ROS 2 adapter maps its types without changing them.
- `rne_planning` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or an
  external motion-planning library; it builds on `rne_robot` types without
  changing them.
- `rne_slam` must not depend on a renderer, physics backend, ROS 2, or external
  SLAM stack; it builds on `rne_nav` types without changing them.
