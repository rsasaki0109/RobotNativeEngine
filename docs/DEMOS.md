# More demos

The README front page keeps the flagship showcase and the vehicle
dynamics / navigation / G1 locomotion highlights. This page holds the rest of
the demo write-ups: full captions, GIFs, and commands for the pieces that
used to live under the README's "Selected demos" section.

## Office AGV delivery

  </picture>
</p>

The tote is a dynamic body moved only by contact: the dock's pusher slides it
onto the AGV's deck, friction carries it (8 mm of slip), and the AGV's own
pusher slides it onto the tray at the desk. On the way the AGV waits at the
yield line while the oncoming AGV comes through the single-lane section, which
is drawn, not collided with. This was a README front-page showcase until the
Go2 door took its place. [metadata](media/showcase-office.json) ·

## Two trucks, one lift

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/warehouse-relay.gif" alt="An orange forklift takes a case off the goods-in stand, turns round and sets it on a stand inside the lift car; the car carries the case up alone and a blue forklift on the upper floor takes it out, turns round and sets it on the outbound bay" width="600">
</p>

A truck on each floor and the lift as the conveyor between them. The
ground-floor truck sets the case on a stand inside the car and backs out; the
car goes up with only the case; the upper-floor truck forks it out and
delivers it. A light-curtain check holds the doors while anything is in the
doorway, and the case moves 6 mm and 1.5 mm on the two trucks' tines. Driving
and turning are commanded; the wheels are not modelled.

## Camera-based localization with visloc-rs

    <img src="media/triple_demo.gif" alt="Third-person 3DGS view of a URDF diff-drive robot carrying a stereo camera, the first-person view, and a 2D map with ground truth and the localized trail" width="640">

  <sub>A URDF mobile base with a stereo camera drives a U-shaped route through the real-capture Dr Johnson 3DGS interior. Top: third-person view. Bottom-left: first-person (the exported cameras).

</p>

Example 113 runs a deterministic diff-drive episode in a photo-derived 3DGS
interior and exports an EuRoC-format stereo + IMU dataset (cameras at 20 Hz,
IMU at 60 Hz, ground truth, Double-Sphere calibration). The RNE side owns the
scene, the robot, and the sensors; [visloc-rs](https://github.com/rsasaki0109/visloc-rs)
consumes the export for VIO and map-matching relocalization against a map built
from a separate episode.

```bash
cargo run -p drjohnson_euroc_export --example 113_drjohnson_euroc_export -- target/drjohnson_euroc
```

  <br>
  <sub>PLATEAU city import: official tile, traffic signals, kinematic vehicles, and sensor overlay.</sub>
</p>

Example 46 imports a bounded official PLATEAU Sanjo City tile once, then renders
both the deterministic 100-actor traffic capture and a bounded, controlled
quadrotor flight through the same detailed streetscape. Example 47 replays the
traffic runtime headlessly. The hero vehicle carries physics-aware LiDAR and
RGB-D sensors with seeded noise, material response, timing, and replayable output.

```bash
cargo run -p plateau_drone_gif --example 46_plateau_drone_gif
cargo run -p traffic_city_replay --example 47_traffic_city_replay
```

## Native motion planning

`rne_planning` is a deterministic, MoveIt-inspired joint-space planning layer
built on the generic `rne_robot` kinematic model and collision checker: planning
scene and SRDF groups, goal and path constraints, a planner registry and
pipeline, PTP/LIN/CIRC motions, RRT-Connect, RRT*, informed RRT*, PRM,
BIT\*-style, CHOMP and STOMP trajectory optimization, hybrid planning, and
request adapters with velocity- and acceleration-limited time parameterization.
No MoveIt or ROS dependency is added to core.

```

## Native articulated dynamics

`rne_dynamics` is the backend-neutral, deterministic articulated-body dynamics
layer that model-based legged and mobile-manipulation control builds on: spatial
algebra, the composite-rigid-body mass matrix, recursive Newton-Euler inverse
dynamics with gravity and velocity bias, deterministic forward dynamics, the
center of mass, and the center-of-mass Jacobian. Fixed- and floating-base trees
are supported, and the Go2 diagnostics example checks the equation of motion on
a real 18-DoF quadruped.

```bash
cargo run -p dynamics_diagnostics --example 103_dynamics_diagnostics
```

See [articulated-body dynamics](architecture/012_dynamics.md).

## Hard-contact time stepping on fractal terrain

`rne_dynamics::contact_step` advances an articulated model with unilateral
contacts and the exact Coulomb cone, solved per contact with bisection in the
style of RaiSim, and integrates joint PD implicitly so stiff gains stay stable.
`rne_physics::FractalTerrain` generates seeded RaiSim-style height maps. Example
133 drops the Go2 onto such terrain, lets it stand on its four feet with
stand-pose PD only, checks that the contacts carry its weight, and replays the
run to confirm it is bit-for-bit deterministic.

```bash
cargo run -p go2_contact_terrain --example 133_go2_contact_terrain
```

Example 134 trots the Go2 across generated terrain on the same step: an
open-loop diagonal trot on implicit PD inside the Go2's declared actuator effort
limits, covering about 2.8 m in 8 s with roll and pitch under 0.15 rad.

```bash
cargo run -p go2_terrain_trot --example 134_go2_terrain_trot
```

Example 135 drives the Go2 with the feedback trot of `rne_locomotion` over
rougher terrain: it tracks 0.4 m/s, turns 2 rad on command, and is level again
a second after a 250 N lateral push, with example 134's open-loop gait run on
the same course for comparison.

```bash
cargo run --release -p go2_feedback_trot --example 135_go2_feedback_trot
```

Example 136 batches 32 Go2 terrain episodes — each with its own terrain,
heading, and command — and steps them in parallel with
`VectorizedEpisode::step_parallel`, the raisimGym pattern, checking that the
parallel batch replays the serial one bit for bit.

```bash
cargo run --release -p go2_parallel_rl --example 136_go2_parallel_rl
```

Example 137 builds the Go2 the way the asset loader does and drives it through
the backend-neutral `PhysicsBackend` loop on `rne_physics_native`, the native
backend built on the same step, and on Rapier for comparison.

```bash
cargo run --release -p go2_native_backend --example 137_go2_native_backend
```

See [hard-contact time stepping](architecture/016_contact_dynamics.md).

## Native legged walking templates

`rne_legged` is the deterministic, backend-free template layer for legged
walking: the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model, Divergent Component of Motion and
capture point, closed-form capture-point foot placement, Kajita-style ZMP
preview control, footstep plans with smooth double-support transitions, and a
full center-of-mass walking pattern. It turns a footstep request into a
replayable trajectory without a physics backend or renderer.

```bash
cargo run -p legged_pattern --example 104_legged_pattern
```

See [legged walking templates](architecture/013_legged_templates.md).

The same crate adds a classical **centroidal layer** for dynamic maneuvers: a
single-rigid-body contact-force distribution with a Coulomb friction cone,
Raibert foot placement, and a minimal-jerk swing trajectory, following the
open-source `cajun` and `go2-convex-mpc` centroidal controllers. This is the
reduced-order abstraction a push-off / flight / landing controller needs.

## Native whole-body control

`rne_wbc` realizes task-space objectives as joint torques on a floating-base
articulated model: a deterministic weighted inverse-dynamics solve over joint
accelerations and contact wrenches, with the floating-base equations of motion
and contact no-slip rows, friction-cone projection, and torque recovery from
`rne_dynamics`. The Go2 example supports the exact body weight through four foot
contacts with a base-residual below `1e-8`.

```bash
cargo run -p whole_body_control --example 105_whole_body_control
```

See [whole-body control](architecture/014_whole_body_control.md).

## Native optimal control

`rne_oc` is the native Crocoddyl-style layer for generating agile maneuvers:
a discrete shooting problem solved by **DDP** with Levenberg-Marquardt
regularization and a backtracking line search, central-difference dynamics
derivatives, quadratic running/terminal costs, and an `ArticulatedDynamics`
adapter that integrates `rne_dynamics` forward dynamics. A pendulum swings up
from hanging to upright under the solver, deterministically and without any
external optimal-control library.

See [native optimal control](architecture/015_native_optimal_control.md).

Example 109 plans a Go2 **crouch–push–flight jump** with the FDDP solver and
executes it with the whole-body controller.

  <sub>Crouch–push–flight jump planned by the native FDDP solver, executed by the whole-body controller with torque feed-forward and low-gain tracking. The body rises 0.107 m, the feet clear 44 mm, and the peak lean is 0.33 rad (0.73 rad before the feed-forward). <a href="../examples/109_go2_jump_sim/main.rs">source</a></sub>
